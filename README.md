ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Job Scraper and Notifier is a Python-based automation script that monitors job listings from specified websites, detects updates, and notifies users via email when new job postings are found.
It is particularly useful for job seekers who want to stay updated with the latest job openings without manually checking websites. The script uses BeautifulSoup to extract job details, hashlib to track changes, and smtplib to send email notifications.

âœ… Email Notifications â€“ Sends an email when new jobs are found, keeping users updated.
